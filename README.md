# National_Tsing_Hua_University_Thesis_Template_2025_Update

- This repository is based on [https://github.com/elsa-lab/NTHUthesis](https://github.com/elsa-lab/NTHUthesis) and updated according to the latest NTHU thesis format guidelines described in [this document](https://registra.site.nthu.edu.tw/var/file/211/1211/img/153498830.pdf).  
- **Key changes:**  
  - Citation format should use `\citep{}`.
  - Include **5–7 keywords** in the abstract.
  - Remove hyperlink borders (disable link frames in PDF).
  - No need to manually add a watermark — the NTHU Dissertations & Theses Repository (清大博碩士論文庫) will add it automatically.
  - No need to manually encrypt the PDF — encryption will be applied automatically.
