\section{Clinical Background}
\subsection{Risk of Prolonged Ventilation in ICU}
Mechanical ventilation is a critical life-support intervention in intensive care units for patients with respiratory failure \citep{ref02, ref01}. 

\subsection{Overview of the Traditional RL Framework}
In an RL framework shown in figure~\ref{fig:RL_framework}, an \emph{agent} interacts with an \emph{environment} to learn an optimal policy.
